    <h1>TallyTalk Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 21, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>TallyTalk ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Voice Recordings:</strong> TallyTalk uses your device's microphone to record voice memos for expense tracking. These recordings are processed to extract expense information and are not stored permanently unless you choose to save them.</p>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create an account, we collect your email address and authentication credentials to provide you with a personalized experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial Data:</strong> The expense and income data you enter (amounts, categories, descriptions) is stored securely to provide the app's core functionality.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To process voice recordings and convert them to expense entries</li>
        <li>To store and display your financial tracking data</li>
        <li>To sync your data across devices when logged in</li>
        <li>To improve our services and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h2>Microphone Permission</h2>

        <li>Share audio recordings with third parties</li>
        <li>Use recordings for advertising purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authentication (Google Sign-In)</li>
        <li>Data storage (Supabase)</li>
        <li>Speech-to-text processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies governing the use of your information.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data for as long as your account is active. You can request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your personal data</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate data</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your data</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent for data processing</li>
    </ul>
