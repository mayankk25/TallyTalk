    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <p>This privacy policy describes how Mayank Agrawal ("we", "us", or "our"), the developer of <strong>TallyTalk</strong>, collects, uses, stores, shares, and protects your personal information when you use our mobile application. TallyTalk is a voice-based expense tracking app available on iOS and Android.</p>

    <p>By using TallyTalk, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong> — provided directly or via Google or Apple Sign-In</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication credentials</strong> — passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text; OAuth tokens are managed securely by our authentication provider</li>
        <li><strong>User ID</strong> — a unique identifier assigned to your account</li>
        <li><strong>Account creation date</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Financial Data</h3>
    <p>To provide the app's core functionality, we collect and store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Expense and income amounts</li>
        <li>Transaction descriptions</li>
        <li>Transaction categories</li>
        <li>Transaction dates</li>
        <li>Transaction type (expense or income)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Voice and Audio Data</h3>
    <p>When you use the voice recording feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Audio is recorded locally on your device in M4A format</li>
        <li>The audio is converted to base64 and transmitted to our server for processing</li>
        <li>Our server sends the audio to OpenAI's Whisper API for speech-to-text transcription</li>
        <li>The resulting text transcript is stored with your expense record</li>
        <li><strong>Audio files are not permanently stored</strong> — they are deleted from your device after processing, and OpenAI does not retain audio data submitted via their API</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Voice Transcripts</h3>
    <p>The text transcription of your voice recording is stored in our database alongside the associated expense entry. This allows you to review what was spoken when the expense was created.</p>

    <h3>1.5 User Preferences</h3>
    <p>We store the following preferences locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Currency preference</li>
        <li>Voice language preference</li>
        <li>Onboarding completion status</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These preferences are not transmitted to our servers.</p>

    <h3>1.6 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
    <p>TallyTalk does <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Contacts or address book data</li>
        <li>Photos, videos, or files (other than voice recordings you initiate)</li>
        <li>Device identifiers for advertising purposes</li>
        <li>Browsing history</li>
        <li>Analytics or usage tracking data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Expense tracking:</strong> To process, store, and display your financial transaction data</li>
        <li><strong>Voice processing:</strong> To convert your voice recordings into text and extract expense details</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> To create and manage your account and keep your data secure</li>
        <li><strong>Data synchronization:</strong> To sync your data across devices when you are signed in</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data for advertising, profiling, or selling to third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We share your data only with the following third-party service providers, solely for the purpose of operating the app:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Service Provider</th>
            <th>Data Shared</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Supabase</strong> (backend infrastructure)</td>
            <td>Account information, financial data, voice transcripts</td>
            <td>Database hosting, user authentication, server-side processing</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Voice audio data (transient), text transcripts</td>
            <td>Speech-to-text transcription and expense parsing</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Authentication tokens (only if you choose Google Sign-In)</td>
            <td>Account authentication</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Apple</strong> (Sign in with Apple)</td>

            <td>Account authentication</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal information to any third party.</p>

    <h2>4. Device Permissions</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Microphone</h3>
    <p>TallyTalk requires microphone access to record voice memos for expense tracking. Audio is only recorded when you explicitly tap the record button. We do not record audio in the background or without your knowledge.</p>

    <h3>4.2 Internet</h3>
    <p>Required to sync your data, process voice recordings, and authenticate your account.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>5.1 In Transit</h3>
    <p>All data transmitted between your device and our servers uses HTTPS/TLS encryption.</p>

    <h3>5.2 At Rest</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Server-side:</strong> Your data is stored in a Supabase-managed PostgreSQL database with encryption at rest and row-level security policies that ensure you can only access your own data.</li>
        <li><strong>On-device:</strong> Session tokens and preferences are stored using platform-standard secure storage mechanisms (Keychain on iOS, encrypted SharedPreferences on Android).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Passwords</h3>
    <p>Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage. We never store or have access to your plain-text password.</p>

    <h3>5.4 Audio Files</h3>
    <p>Voice recordings are temporary. They exist on your device only during processing and are deleted immediately after the transcription is complete. Audio is not stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

    <h3>6.1 Retention</h3>
    <p>We retain your account and financial data for as long as your account is active. Voice audio files are not retained — only the resulting text transcript is stored.</p>

    <h3>6.2 Account Deletion</h3>
    <p>You can delete your account at any time from within the app (Settings > Delete Account). When you delete your account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All your expense and income records are permanently deleted</li>
        <li>All custom categories you created are permanently deleted</li>
        <li>Your authentication account and associated data are permanently deleted</li>
        <li>Local preferences on your device are cleared upon sign-out</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Account deletion is immediate and irreversible. We do not retain your data after deletion.</p>

    <h3>6.3 Sign Out</h3>
    <p>Signing out clears your local session data. Your account and stored data remain on our servers and are accessible when you sign back in.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong> your personal data — all your data is visible within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Delete</strong> your account and all associated data — available in app Settings</li>
        <li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> — you can revoke microphone permission at any time through your device settings; you can stop using voice features without affecting other app functionality</li>
        <li><strong>Data portability</strong> — contact us to request an export of your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>TallyTalk is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected data from a child under 13, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>

    <h2>9. Home Screen Widget</h2>
    <p>TallyTalk offers an optional home screen widget ("QuickRecord") for quick access to the voice recording feature. The widget does not access, display, or transmit any user data. It simply provides a shortcut to open the app's recording screen.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
